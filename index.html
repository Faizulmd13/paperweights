        <h2>Random Paperweights with no importance</h2>
        <p>
          When Loki from an alternate 2012 was taken into custody by the Time
          Variance Authority and escaped their confinement, he forced a TVA
          clerk named Casey to return the Tesseract to him. However, when he was
          given the Tesseract, Loki saw that it was in a drawer that contained
          several other Infinity Stones from various alternate timelines. Casey
          then told Loki that some employees used Infinity Stones as
          paperweights since they were powerless inside the Time Variance
          Authority Office.

              The Space Stone is one of the six Infinity Stones, an ancient
              artifact capable of manipulating space to provide instant travel
              to any location in the universe. Originally housed within the
              Tesseract—a blue, cube-like containment vessel designed for safer
              handling—the stone was used by various civilizations to power
              advanced weaponry.

              The Mind Stone is a yellow Infinity Stone that grants the wielder
              vast mental powers, including telepathy, telekinesis, and the
              ability to subjugate others' wills. Originally housed within a
              blue gem atop Loki’s Scepter, the stone acted as a powerful,
              sentient artificial intelligence—one that eventually served as the
              foundational blueprint for Ultron.

              The Reality Stone is a red Infinity Stone that originally
              manifested as the Aether, a dark, viscous liquid. Unlike the other
              stones, it acts as a symbiotic force that can be absorbed by a
              living host, granting them the power to warp reality, manipulate
              matter, and overwrite the physical laws of the universe.

              devastating energy. At its peak, the stone possesses enough
              destructive force to obliterate an entire planet.

              The Time Stone is a green Infinity Stone housed within the Eye of
              Agamotto, a pendant created by the first Sorcerer Supreme. It
              allows a skilled wielder to manipulate the flow of time—enabling
              them to reverse events, accelerate time to see potential futures,
              or trap enemies in infinite time loops.

              The Soul Stone is an orange Infinity Stone considered by some to
              be the most dangerous of the set. It possesses a unique form of
              sentience and resides on the desolate planet Vormir, where it was
              overseen by the Red Skull acting as its stonekeeper.
